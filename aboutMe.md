### Research Interests

Computational Fluid Dynamics, Finite Volume Method, Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems

### Current Research Project

Development and validation of a six-degrees-of-freedom (6dof) motion solver for the CFD code
OpenFoam. Target features:

* Compatible with Overset (Chimera) mesh structure, so that high amplitude motions can be supported.
* Any number of degrees of freedom can be prescribed and remaining resolved for, so pure rotations or pure translations  are supported.
* Tight coupling between fluid and structure solver
